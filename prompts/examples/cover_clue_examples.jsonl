{"question": "Hi there, I read this book in highschool around 2002-2005. From what I remember, the main character is nicknamed \"Mouse\" and she rides a big chestnut horse in jumper shows.

I think the title was one word--it may have been the name of the horse.I cannot remember the name or the author of this book. I have googled everything I can think of but I cannot to find this book and its driving me crazy! I'd be grateful for any help on this! Thank you!", "cover_clue": "The cover just showed a chestnut horse and rider in mid jump."}
{"question": "So I read this book somewhere between 2008-2010 when I was in elementary school or middle school. It was about a girl who lived by the sea, and started out with her having dinner at this boarding house she lived in. And something happened (she received a fruit or something else that was banned in her town) and she had to hide it. Then, the landlady of her house got mad when she found out. The MC went down to the beach and saw this giant walrus thing (I can't remember clearly but I think there was also a guy who rode the walrus but maybe not) and the MC got on the walrus and they rode away to this magical land. I don't remember much else, except the story had something to do with fruits for some reason, and the characters mother was likely from this magical land. Also, in the end, the main character brings Color and happiness back to her seaside village and I think there's something else to do with strawberries. Please help! I've been searching for this book for years! Thanks so much <3", "cover_clue": "N/A"}
{"question": "I remember reading this around 2008/2009. It was about a girl being prettier than her mother, and when the mother gets jealous she sends her daughter to a type of boarding school for people who are well-known (Like nobles and princesses. She may be royalty). The cover was purple and captivating,(which was why I picked the book to read ^^) with a girl's face on it. However, I'm not sure if the cover really had a face on it, or if it was completely purple.(view spoiler)[I believe that at the end, a minion of the girl's mother helped the girl get rid of her mother. Maybe it was because the mother tried to kill her daughter for being beautiful, especially since she was getting older. (hide spoiler)]Please help me find it. It was the first book that got me to love reading at that time. :)", "cover_clue": "The cover was purple and captivating,(which was why I picked the book to read ^^) with a girl's face on it.

{"question": "I probably read this book in the late 90s, early 2000s, and cannot find the title anywhere. The main character is an outcast in her high school who lives in a trailer park near a cemetery. From what I remember she was walking through the cemetery trying to clear her mind when she wondered upon a funeral that had very few people at the funeral. After that she starts attending funerals on the weekend. She even has an outfit she wears just to go to these funerals.", "cover_clue": "N/A"}
{"question": "hi im looking for a book there was two girls. the older one liked dumpster diving and had a duck shaped jar of memories that she could go into. the younger one was blonde and liked buying shirts from a thrift store and writing on them, and she couldn’t remember anyone’s faces. the younger one tried to mail her mom a coconut and the mailman was the only face she could remember. there was also a woman in a hospital who only said “red shoes” and the cover was green or blue. was read a couple years ago so probably 2017-2019ish?", "cover_clue": "the cover was green or blue."}
{"question": "This book was blue (if that helps). And I think it had a mailbox on the front of it. There were three girls and they hated their rival school. So to get the two schools to be friends they made everyone send letters to another person in the school. One girl got a guy who wanted to impress a girl at his school so him and the girl he was sending letters went on on \"Practice Dates\" And they ended up liking each other :) The other girl likes playing \"Games\" with her letter guy... i dont really remember what happened with them. And the third girl had a jerk as her letter guy.. I dont really remeber what happened with him either.If anyone knows the name of the book I'm looking for would you please let me know? :) Thanks so much :) :) :)", "cover_clue": "This book was blue (if that helps).

{"question": "So I do not remember but the title, author, or cover, but I remember a bit of the plot. I believe it starts out with the main characters set up on a date. They don’t know each other’s names, but their date consists of a sexy “get to know you”/photo shoot where they’re not allowed to have sex but they do anyway. She gets pregnant but can’t find him after. Flash forward a bit, she works for her father’s large New York office and they make a deal to with with her baby daddy’s office. He finds out she’s pregnant and so the story goes. I hope this is enough to go on and someone recognizes it. Thank you!", "cover_clue": "N/A"}
