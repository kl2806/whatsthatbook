{"question": "Set in tunnels of Victorian London, a fantasy type book (magical or mysterious characters). I read this paperback in the mid to late 90's. Cover was in blues and blacks depicting silhouette(s) and dark wet foggy London street, I believe. Outstanding book, Adult fiction (or not young adult - just real scary/intriguing, no sex or anything like that). I seem to remember a crow in this book(?). This band of misfits/mysterious characters mostly reside in tunnels of London. Book was quite the thriller, although not really monsters. I did wake up screaming one night. Only book that ever did that to me, because the plot was so intense I think. I thought I had found it with the name \"Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\" but that was not it. Book I'm looking for has a male author I believe", "author_clue": "Book I'm looking for has a male author I believe"}

But, what I do remember:* The title of the book was three words;* The title included either the word \"hand(s)\" or \"finger(s)\"* It had a dark blue cover;* The book was about 300-350 pages long, which I'm guessing from the thickness;* The author's name was two words, not more; (I think it was a female author)* The book was something about a main character meeting with several new and strange characters (which I believe included a dog).* Could be young adult, could be general fiction. Could even be magical realism.", "author_clue": "The author's name was two words, not more; (I think it was a female author)"}
