{"question": "I remember reading this around 2008/2009. It was about a girl being prettier than her mother, and when the mother gets jealous she sends her daughter to a type of boarding school for people who are well-known (Like nobles and princesses. She may be royalty). The cover was purple and captivating,(which was why I picked the book to read ^^) with a girl's face on it. However, I'm not sure if the cover really had a face on it, or if it was completely purple.(view spoiler)[I believe that at the end, a minion of the girl's mother helped the girl get rid of her mother. Maybe it was because the mother tried to kill her daughter for being beautiful, especially since she was getting older. (hide spoiler)]Please help me find it. It was the first book that got me to love reading at that time. :)", "question_posted_date": "2014-07-30", "date_clue": "2009"}

{"question": "So this is set in a small American (I think) town. It's a mystery/drama. 30-40 year old female lead character who had a steamy session with some guy in a car near the beginning of the book.I remember two scenes, one where a young kid who was in a Biology class dissecting a frog started stabbing it violently and threw it across the classroom. The other where a kid (maybe the same one) is shot in the head and killed by some cops (or maybe it was the army) after he went crazy or something; I believe the female lead was being held hostage by the kid at that point or maybe she was just there with him.I'm pretty sure the plot mostly revolves around trying to work out why these kids are going crazy. I read it at least 5 years ago although it was probably written for 18+ year olds. I have a feeling the author is female too.Thanks for any help", "question_posted_date": "2014-11-10", "date_clue": 2009}
