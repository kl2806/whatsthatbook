{"question": "The book is a story based in first-person, but through the eyes of 2 people. It's a WW2 book and the main characters are on opposite sides, the book tells of a patriotic German who likes Nazism and wants to be part of the army. The American boy wants to serve for his country. Towards the end the German boy and American boy are fighting across a field and a German is shot but not killed, and upon nightfall the German soldier can be heard yelling for help. The American then goes down in the middle of the night and helps the German soldier.", "plot_clue": "story based in first-person, but through the eyes of 2 people.

{"question": "I was in a bookshop a few weeks ago and saw this book that had a blue, winter themed cover. According to the blurb, the story is about a brother and sister who get separated and one of them has to take care of the tribe (I think their father was the chief). Anyways, I wanted to buy the book but when I came back it wasn't there anymore, so now I'm trying to find one on the internet. The title probably had the words \"quest\" or \"fire\" but my memory is kind of hazy, so i don't remember so much. If you could help with any suggestions that would be great!", "plot_clue": "the story is about a brother and sister who get separated and one of them has to take care of the tribe (I think their father was the chief)."}
{"question": "I am looking for a book series that I read in primary school. This series was about a stray dog who saves his adoptive family from various wildlife in each book.

{"question": "It's a series of six books, I think, but am only 90% sure. There could be more. The main character is a girl called Jill and I think she's about 12 years old, but I'm not sure, it's just what I'm thinking. I read them when I was about 8-10 years old, so that would've been in 1998-2000. I don't think the books where new by then, but my mom didn't read them as a kid, they were too new for that.My books had a light blue color, but they were Danish, so that might not be helpful to you.In Danish, they all had titles with the name Jill in them, which I think is true for the English ones as well.Does anyone know what I'm talking about?", "plot_clue": "The main character is a girl called Jill and I think she's about 12 years old"}
